 * Deliberately excludes `telephone`, `address`, `logo` and `sameAs` —
 * those still hold unconfirmed placeholder values in company.ts (see its
 * header comment). Shipping them as structured data would let a crawler
 * index fake business facts as real, which is worse than shipping no
 * structured data for those fields at all. `sameAs` is included only with
 * whatever social links are genuinely confirmed (same gating as the
 * footer's social icons) — currently none, so it's omitted entirely.
 *
 * LocalBusiness schema is intentionally not implemented anywhere in this
 * site until a real address/phone exists — see the project brief.
